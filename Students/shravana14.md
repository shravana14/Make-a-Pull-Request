## About me:

I'm an 34 year old Indian woman interested in coding and all activities involving critical thinking. I like activities that trick my internal clock and lets me stay in the FLOW state. I'm an INTP. I conceive many projects, start few and finish none. I hope my pogramming journey doesn't end that pathetic.


## Languages that I am learning:

- Python
